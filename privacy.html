  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 17, 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Objective.ink is a Safari extension that improves the readability of websites by applying custom stylesheets. It is designed to work entirely on your device with no data collection of any kind.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>Objective.ink does not collect, transmit, store, or share any personal data, usage data, analytics, or browsing information. No data leaves your device.</p>

  <h2>How the Extension Works</h2>
  <p>The extension applies CSS stylesheets to supported websites to improve their visual presentation. All stylesheets are bundled with the app and stored locally on your device. A minimal content script runs on supported pages solely to signal the extension to apply its styles — it does not read, modify, or collect any page content. The extension does not communicate with any external servers.</p>

  <h2>Third Parties</h2>
  <p>Objective.ink does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. No data is shared with any third party.</p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>The extension requires the following browser permissions to function:</p>
  <p><strong>activeTab</strong> — allows the extension to apply styles to the currently active tab when invoked.</p>
  <p><strong>tabs</strong> — allows the extension to detect when a supported page has loaded in order to apply styles and display its status badge.</p>
  <p><strong>scripting</strong> — allows the extension to inject and remove CSS stylesheets on supported pages.</p>
  <p><strong>storage</strong> — stores stylesheet preferences and enabled/disabled state locally on your device.</p>
  <p><strong>nativeMessaging</strong> — enables communication between the Safari extension and the native macOS app to read bundled stylesheets stored on your device.</p>
  <p><strong>webNavigation</strong> — allows the extension to detect when a page navigation has committed so styles can be injected before the page renders.</p>
  <p>None of these permissions are used to collect, transmit, or share any data.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>Since no data is collected, there is no data to retain or delete. The extension stores only its own stylesheet preferences locally on your device. Uninstalling the app removes all associated data.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Objective.ink does not collect any data from any user, including children under the age of 13.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If this policy changes, the updated version will be published at this URL with a revised date.</p>
